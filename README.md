# music_big_data_project

The goal of this academic project is to create an end-to-end data architecture, including data ingestion, transformation and exposition.
I will have to achieve the following tasks :
1. Create jobs that extract data via REST API, from two different sources
2. Create jobs that format these data to transform them into a suitable format to a Data Lake for data analytics purposes
3. Create a job that combines these data sources into an interesting use case
4. Index the data in a dashboard to expose the final output

As a music lover, I decided to use music databases : Discogs and Spotify.
Discogs being the widest music database for artists and labels releases, I want to analyze the Spotify covering of these releases by release dates.
